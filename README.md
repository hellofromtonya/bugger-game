# Bugger Game

This game is a pseudo-clone of the classic "frogger" game.  Like Frogger, you move your character across traffic, avoiding the icky bugs, to get to the safe zone (water at the top of the page).

I built this game as part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program, but added a few twists just for the fun of it.

## How to Play

You can clone or download this game to your computer. Or you can play it in [your browser](https://rawgit.com/hellofromtonya/bugger-game/master/index.html)

1. Select your player's character:

2. Click or select the Play button.  The game will now start.

3. Use the up/down/right/left arrows on your keyboard to move your player

Move into empty spaces, avoiding the bugs.  If your player collides into a bug or a bug gets your player, the game is over.

4. Collect the gems to win more points.
